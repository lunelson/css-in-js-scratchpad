# css-in-js-scratchpad

CLI scripts for inspecting the output from popular CSS-in-JS libs. Supported so far:

- emotion
- styled-components
- linaria (partial)

## Instructions

1. Each source file must import `React` and whatever CSS-in-JS library functions they are using.
2. Each source file must export a React component called `Test`, as a named export.
2. Source files must be placed in their respective library subfolder in `src`.

Open a terminal and invoke the appropriate script for your source file:

```sh
# for files under src/emotion/
yarn emotion source-filename.jsx

# for files under src/styled-components/
yarn styled-components source-filename.jsx

# for files under src/linaria/
yarn linaria source-filename.jsx
```

Check the existing source files for examples ðŸ˜‰.
